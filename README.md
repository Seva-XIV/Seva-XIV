## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hi, I'm Seva ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m a frontend developer with a focus on clean and minimalistic design. I enjoy solving problems with code, and Iâ€™m always inspired by the intersection of art and technology. I love when people have personal websites with a good and professional design, and I enjoy creative design thatâ€™s unusual, easy to read, and pleasant to look at.
