Hi, I'm Seva ðŸ‘‹

With a deep appreciation for suprematism and avant-garde art and a passion for mathematical problem-solving, I discovered a fascinating intersection of creativity and logic in frontend development. After completing a React course, I became captivated by its potential and have since been honing my skills to build unique, professional, aesthetically refined layouts that are easy to read and pleasant to look at.

I'm actively seeking a frontend developer role, ideally in a startup environment where I can contribute meaningfully and grow alongside a tight-knit team. If you're hiring, I'd love to connect!

ðŸ’» Tech Stack: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React

ðŸš€ Projects: Currently building my portfolio to showcase my work
